    <h2>White Bread Recipe</h2>
    <h3><p>This white bread recipe is the best at home recipe for soft, fluffy, 
        buttery sandwich bread at home.</p>
        <p>If you make bread regularly at home, you should already have all the ingredients you need 
            for this uncomplicated recipe, although I highly suggest getting a <em>Stand Mixer</em>
             if you dont already have one, to make your life easier

                        width as the bread pan, and starting from the bottom roll into a log
