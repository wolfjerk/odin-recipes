<h2>Spicy Tuna Bowl</h2>
<h3>
    <p>The best part about this tuna rice bowl is that it is budget friendly and it’s quick to make in under 10 minutes if you have cold leftover rice in the fridge. </p>
    <p>The combination of the spicy tuna rice mixture with a piece of crunchy nori reminds me of Korean Tuna Triangle Kimbap or Japanese Onigiri.</p>
